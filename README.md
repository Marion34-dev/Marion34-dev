# Welcome to my GitHub! 👩‍💻

I started my journey into tech in 2022, with a bootcamp in Software Engineering, with a keen interest but not knowing if it would *really* capture my interest. And it absolutely did, I have discovered that I am genuinely enjoying programming!!! <br><br>
I am currently learning Python 3, SQL and HTML/CSS to name a few. You will find on here some of my programs!
