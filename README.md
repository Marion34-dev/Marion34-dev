Since starting my tech journey in 2022, I have been on a relentless pursuit of knowledge and skills in the field of Software Engineering. 

To kickstart my learning, I embarked on a 3-month course in Software Engineering, where I delved into the foundations of programming using Python 3. This experience provided me with a solid understanding of core programming concepts and helped me develop a strong foundation in problem-solving and logical thinking.

I am now currently studying Software Engineering with Digital Futures. This comprehensive course has exposed me to the vast and exciting realm of JavaScript, and has expanded my repertoire further by diving into Java, an incredibly versatile and powerful language.

Here, you will find a collection of my personal projects, code snippets and contributions to open source projects. I believe in the value of sharing knowledge and collaborating with fellow developers, so feel free to explore my repositories and provide feedback or suggestions. Let's inspire and empower each other on this incredible journey!

Thank you for taking the time to visit my GitHub account.

Happy coding!
